Fake News Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview:
The Fake News Prediction project leverages machine learning algorithms to detect and classify news articles as either fake or real. This project aims to combat the spread of misinformation by providing an automated tool that can evaluate the credibility of news sources.

Features:
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature extraction using TF-IDF
Machine learning model training and evaluation
Support for multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
User-friendly interface for inputting news articles and getting predictions


Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

Python 3.7+
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK
Flask (for the web interface)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for development and testing)

Dataset
You can download a dataset of fake and real news articles from Kaggle or use any other relevant dataset. Place the dataset files in the data directory.

Project Structure:
data/: Directory for storing datasets
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for development and experimentation
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation
models/: Directory for saving trained models
